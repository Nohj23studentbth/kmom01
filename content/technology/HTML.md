HTML
==========================

The fundamental elements of the web are constructed through the combination of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTML serves as the language for creating web pages, and these pages are transmitted over the internet utilizing HTTP.

HTML plays a crucial role in defining the content and structure of websites, facilitating the inclusion of additional documents like CSS or JavaScript files.

The construction of HTML involves the utilization of elements identified by tags. Here is an illustration featuring a paragraph containing a link:

<div class="boxing">
<pre>
&lt;p&gt;A link to my 
&lt;a href="mywebpage.html"&gt;
web page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</div>
