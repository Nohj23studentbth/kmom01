GIT
==========================

Git, devised by Linus Torvalds in 2005, stands as a distributed version control system specifically designed for overseeing alterations in the Linux kernel.

The decentralized nature of Git negates the need for a central repository. Nonetheless, a central repository becomes essential when numerous developers seek to collaborate on identical code.

Traditionally operating as a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, Git has also seen the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools to simplify the initiation process for users.
