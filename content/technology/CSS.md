CSS
==========================

Cascading Style Sheets, CSS, serves as a language to articulate the visual presentation of elements within a markup language, like HTML. CSS stands as one of the pivotal technologies forming the bedrock of the web.

Within CSS, we employ selectors to specify the elements we intend to influence and subsequently define the style for these elements within a block.

For instance, when desiring to assign a blue color to all paragraphs, the process unfolds in the ensuing manner.

<div class="boxing">
<pre>
p {
    color: blue;
}
</pre>
</div>
