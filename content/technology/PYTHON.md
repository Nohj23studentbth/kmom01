PYTHON
==========================

Python, introduced by Guido van Rossum in 1991, is a dynamically typed programming language recognized for its versatility as a general-purpose language, applicable across various domains.

Notably, Python employs a class and object-based approach for all its data types, distinguishing it from other languages. Another distinctive feature is the use of indentation to delineate code blocks.

Here's an example of a Python program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 100:

<div class="boxing">
<pre>
for number in range(1, 100 + 1):
    if not number % 2:
        print(number)
</pre>
</div>
