PHP
==========================

PHP, a widely adopted scripting language, is predominantly employed for developing websites featuring dynamic content. It stands out as the most prevalent server-side programming language on the web, finding application in over 80% of all websites.

PHP embraces an object-oriented programming paradigm, and in its later versions, it can adopt strict typing and even undergo Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

Consider the following PHP code as an example, demonstrating a program that outputs all even numbers between 1 and 100:

<div class="boxing">
<pre>
&lt;?php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 100; $i++) {
    if (!($i % 2)) {
        echo $i . "\n";
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
