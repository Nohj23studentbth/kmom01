JAVASCRIPT
==========================

JavaScript stands as a scripting language based on prototypes and forms an integral part of the web alongside HTML and CSS. It is characterized by its dynamic nature, loose typing, and the treatment of functions as first-class objects.

Despite sharing a C-like syntax, JavaScript bears no resemblance to the Java programming language.

Here's an example of a JavaScript program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 100:

<div class="boxing">
<pre>
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if (!(i % 2)) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
